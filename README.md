## Horiseon-Webpage

# Description

This project is an edit of starting code for a webpage by a marketing agency named Horiseon. My main motivation behind this project is to clean up the starting code and make the HTML document more user friendly, so that the marketing agency can easily see what each part of the HTML represents, and how it correlates to the aesthetics of the website. There were a couple things I did to edit this document. I first noticed one of the links were broken because of a missing ID value, which I added. I then notcied none of the code was semantic and only used Div commands, so I made sure to replace them with clear semantic elements that explained what the sets of code did and how they fit in the page. Afterwards I added alternate text to every image and icon on the page, so that in the event that the texts did not load or a screen reader was used, the alternate text would show. As a finishing touch, I made sure to give a clear and concise title to the webpage. 

## Usage

The main usage of this code is to look as neat as possible, while staying functional and optimal. The main function of this website is to give tips on marketing online, and includes many simple parts. It has a header with three links that will scroll to their corresponding section of information, a background image that takes up most of the screen, three sections at the bottom with information on the best online marketing tips, and an aside with a couple more tips and icons to help make the website pop. The link to the website is listed here: https://brettglerum.github.io/Horiseon-Webpage/
